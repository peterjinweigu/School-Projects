# Factoring complex integer polynomials
# As long as the first coefficient and constant are integers, the program will work
# Finds factors in O(sqrt(a)*sqrt(c)*n)
# Where a is the first coefficient, c is the constant, and n is the degree of the function
# Note: This program will only find linear factors in the form ax + b
