"""
Factoring complex integer polynomials
As long as the first coefficient and constant are integers, the program will work 
Finds factors in O(sqrt(a)*sqrt(c)*n)
Where a is the first coefficient, c is the constant, and n is the degree of the function
Note: This program will only find linear factors in the form ax + b
